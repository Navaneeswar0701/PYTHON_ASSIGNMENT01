# PYTHON_ASSIGNMENT01
1.capitalize
The code you provided prompts the user to input a string, removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input using the strip() method, and then capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string using a list comprehension and the capitalize() method. The capitalized words are then joined together with a space character using the join() method and stored in the capitalized variable. Finally, the capitalized string is printed to the console.
 
2.This code imports the Counter class from the collections module, which is used to count the occurrences of characters in a string. The if __name__ == '__main__': statement checks whether the code is being run as the main program (as opposed to being imported as a module), and if so, executes the following code block.
3.This code takes an input of a matrix of characters and transposes it. Then, the characters are concatenated into a string, and all non-alphanumeric characters except for spaces are removed using a regular expression. Finally, consecutive non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with a single space, and the resulting decoded string is printed to the console.
4.This code takes input from the user in the form of the number of lists to be entered (n) and a value of mul. It then prompts the user to input n lists of integers. The maximum value of each list is found and appended to a new list m. The sum of the squares of the elements in m is then calculated, and the result is taken modulo mul to obtain the final answer.
5.This code defines a function minion_game that takes a string as input and calculates the score for two players - Kevin and Stuart - in a word game. The game is played as follows: the players take turns to form substrings of the input string, with each substring starting with a consonant or a vowel. The score of a player is the total number of substrings they form that start with a consonant or a vowel, depending on which player they are.
6.This code validates a postal code entered by the user using regular expressions in Python. A postal code is considered valid if it has six digits, the first of which is between 1 and 9, and there are no alternating repetitive digits.
7.This Python code reads an integer n from the user, followed by n fractions. It then calculates the product of these fractions, simplifies the resulting fraction, and prints the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.

The code first imports the Fraction class from the fractions module, which is used to represent fractions as objects. It also imports the reduce function from the functools module, which is used to apply a function to a list of values, accumulating the result.
8.This program defines a function called swap_case that takes a string s as input and returns a modified string where each uppercase letter is converted to lowercase and each lowercase letter is converted to uppercase. The function uses a loop to iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase using the lower() method and appended to a result string. If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase using the upper() method and appended to the result string. If the character is not a letter (e.g., a space or a punctuation mark), it is appended to the result string as is
9.This code prints out the first n-1 terms of the series 1, 22, 333, 4444, ... where each term is made up of a repeating digit equal to its position in the series. For example, the first term is 1 (one 1), the second term is 22 (two 2's), the third term is 333 (three 3's), and so on. The formula (10**i//9)*i is used to generate the ith term of the series.
10.code prompts the user to input a number n and then takes n words as input. It then counts the occurrences of each word and outputs the number of distinct words and their occ
